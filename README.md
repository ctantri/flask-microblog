# Flask Microblog

The microblog web app is the overarching project of the _Flask Mega-Tutorial_ by Miguel Grinberg. The end product can be found at https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog. 

I am following the tutorial from scratch in this repository, though unlike the tutorial I am using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management.
